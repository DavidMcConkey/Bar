# BarMate

With a background in Bartending, the amount of times someone would ask me for some cocktail I've never heard of is inumerable. Google always offered way too many variations, which is why I came up with BarMate!
BarMate is a bartenders best friend, it displays all cocktails that are certified by the IBA (International Bartender Association) as well as some fun extras! With correct measurements and necessary garnishes, it's easy to quickly use the filter or search bar to find exactly which cocktail you need to make.

The main page is where the user can find all the cocktails through scrolling ,searching, or filtering a number of ways. In addition to this the user can favorite their most made drinks so they are easily found in the future.

The bar page is where the user can select ingredients they have at their disposal to find out which of the cocktails they can make, and filter effectively.

Settings is where the user can manipulate certain things like theme, units of alcohol, color, as well as a couple other fun options!
